Additional Clauses:

1. **Open Source Principles:** This Software is released as open-source software.  The licensor intends for this license to be compatible with the principles of open source, including the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the Software. This license is intended to be a permissive open-source license, similar in spirit to the MIT license.

2. No Endorsement:  This license does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the licensor, except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
    Software and reproducing the content of the notice.

3. No Implied AI Guarantees:  The Software integrates with third-party AI models
    (specifically, Ollama).  The licensor makes no guarantees about the
    accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the outputs generated by these
    AI models.  Users are solely responsible for evaluating the AI-generated
    content and its appropriateness for their use case.  The licensor is not
    responsible for any decisions or actions taken based on the AI-generated
    output.

4. Data Privacy: The Software, by default, interacts with locally hosted AI models
    via Ollama. It does not transmit data to any external servers controlled by
    the licensor *unless* the user explicitly configures it to do so (e.g., by
    changing the Ollama URL to point to a remote server).  Users are responsible
    for understanding the data privacy implications of any third-party services
    they connect to.  The licensor is not responsible for data transmitted to
    third-party services.

5. Good Faith Use: Users are expected to use the Software in good faith and
    in a manner that does not violate any applicable laws or regulations,
    or infringe upon the rights of others.  This includes, but is not limited
    to, avoiding the use of the Software to create or distribute malicious,
    harmful, or unethical content.

6. Updates and Maintenance: While the licensor may provide updates or maintenance
    for the software, they are under no obligation to do so. The software is provided
    on an "as available" basis.

7. Severability: If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:

    a. This License is intended to be international in scope.  The licensor's intent is that the rights and obligations under this License be interpreted and enforced as consistently as possible across all jurisdictions.

    b.  Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this License or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the defendant is located (if the defendant is an individual, their place of residence; if the defendant is a corporation or other entity, its principal place of business).

    c. The courts of the jurisdiction determined according to paragraph (b) shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any such dispute, claim, or controversy, to the extent permitted by applicable law. This clause is not intended to prevent any party from seeking remedies in any jurisdiction where such remedies are available and necessary to protect their rights.

    d. This clause is without prejudice to any mandatory consumer protection laws or other applicable laws that cannot be waived or limited by contract, and which may provide for a different governing law or jurisdiction.

    e.  The parties agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve any disputes informally before resorting to formal legal proceedings.
