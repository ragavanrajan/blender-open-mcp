## üéØ Basic Object Creation

### Simple Object Creation
```
"Create a blue CUBE in Blender and place it at position (2, 0, 1)"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Always use uppercase object types: `CUBE`, `SPHERE`, `CYLINDER`, `PLANE`, `CONE`, `TORUS`, `MONKEY`

### Multiple Objects
```
"I need to create a basic scene with:
- A red SPHERE at the center
- A green CYLINDER to the left at (-3, 0, 0)  
- A yellow CONE to the right at (3, 0, 0)
Make them all the same size."
```

### Geometric Arrangements
```
"Create a circle of 6 CUBES around the origin. Each CUBE should be 4 units away from the center and have a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple)."
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Scene Composition

### Architectural Mockup
```
"Help me create a simple building mockup:
1. Create a large cube as the base building (scale it to 4x4x6)
2. Add a smaller cube on top as a second floor (scale 2x2x3)
3. Place a cone on top as a roof
4. Add some cylinder pillars at the corners of the base
5. Use appropriate materials - gray for building, brown for pillars, red for roof"
```

### Product Display Scene
```
"Set up a product photography scene in Blender:
- Create a white plane as the background/floor (scale it large)
- Add a golden sphere as the main product in the center
- Place 3 small cubes around it as accent pieces
- Make the cubes different metallic colors (silver, copper, bronze)
- Position everything for a clean, professional look"
```

### Abstract Art Installation
```
"Create an abstract art piece with:
- 5 spheres of different sizes floating at different heights
- 3 twisted cylinders (rotate them at interesting angles)
- A large plane underneath as the base
- Use a gradient of colors from warm to cool across all objects
- Make it look like a modern sculpture installation"
```

## üé® Material & Styling

### Metallic Collection
```
"Create a materials showcase:
1. Make 4 cubes in a row
2. Apply different metallic materials:
   - First cube: Gold (RGB: 1.0, 0.8, 0.0)
   - Second cube: Silver (RGB: 0.9, 0.9, 0.9)
   - Third cube: Copper (RGB: 0.8, 0.4, 0.2)
   - Fourth cube: Bronze (RGB: 0.6, 0.4, 0.2)
3. Space them evenly along the X-axis"
```

### Color Palette Exploration
```
"I'm working on a brand identity. Create a color palette visualization:
- 6 spheres arranged in a hexagon pattern
- Each sphere represents a brand color:
  - Primary: Deep blue (0.1, 0.2, 0.8)
  - Secondary: Bright orange (1.0, 0.5, 0.0)
  - Accent 1: Lime green (0.5, 1.0, 0.2)
  - Accent 2: Purple (0.6, 0.2, 0.8)
  - Neutral 1: Light gray (0.8, 0.8, 0.8)
  - Neutral 2: Dark gray (0.3, 0.3, 0.3)
Make them glow and look professional."

## üí° Pro Tips for Better Prompts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Object Type Case Sensitivity**
**The most common error!** Object types MUST be uppercase:
- ‚úÖ **Correct:** `CUBE`, `SPHERE`, `CYLINDER`, `PLANE`, `CONE`, `TORUS`, `MONKEY`
- ‚ùå **Wrong:** `cube`, `sphere`, `cylinder` (will cause "Invalid object type" error)

**Example Error:**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid object type: 'cube'. Must be one of: CUBE, SPHERE, CYLINDER, PLANE, CONE, TORUS, MONKEY",
  "error_code": "INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE"
}
```

### üéØ **Be Specific with Coordinates**
Instead of: *"Put it somewhere on the left"*  
Use: *"Place it at position (-3, 0, 0)"*

### üé® **Use Exact Color Values**
Instead of: *"Make it reddish"*  
Use: *"Apply red material with RGB values (0.8, 0.2, 0.1)"*

### üìê **Specify Object Types Clearly**
Instead of: *"Add a round thing"*  
Use: *"Create a SPHERE object"*

### üîÑ **Break Complex Tasks into Steps**
Instead of: *"Make a complex building"*  
Use: *"First create the base structure, then add details, then apply materials"*

### üé≠ **Reference Real-World Examples**
Instead of: *"Make something cool"*  
Use: *"Create a scene inspired by modern architecture with clean lines and metallic materials"*

## üöÄ Advanced Integration Examples

### Batch Processing
```
"I need to create a product lineup visualization:
1. Create 5 different objects (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus)
2. Arrange them in a line with 2 units spacing
3. Apply the same gold material to all of them
4. Scale each one slightly different to show size variations
5. Add a backdrop plane behind them
This will be used for our product catalog."
```

### Animation Preparation
```
"Set up a scene for animation:
- Create a sphere that will be our bouncing ball
- Position it at (0, 0, 5) - high up
- Create a plane below at (0, 0, 0) as the ground
- Apply a bright red material to the ball
- Apply a neutral gray to the ground
- Make sure everything is positioned for a bouncing animation"
```

### Architectural Visualization
```
"Create an architectural concept:
1. Build a modern house using cubes of different sizes
2. Main structure: large cube (6x4x3) as the base
3. Add a smaller cube (3x4x3) as an extension
4. Create a flat roof using a thin cube on top
5. Add window 'holes' using smaller cubes positioned as cutouts
6. Use white materials for walls, dark gray for roof
7. Add some landscaping cubes around as bushes"
```
