## üö® **CRITICAL: Copilot Studio Connector Issues**

### **Missing Input Fields Problem**
If your Copilot Studio connector only shows the `type` field and is missing `name`, `location`, `rotation`, and `scale` fields:

**üîß Solution Steps:**
1. **Delete the existing connector** in Copilot Studio
2. **Re-import the connector** using the same Swagger URL: `https://blender-open-mcp-de.com/config/swagger/blender-mcp-separate-endpoints.yaml`
3. **Verify all fields appear**: You should see 5 input fields total
4. **Test the connection** before using in prompts

**üìã Expected Input Fields:**
- `type` (String, Required) - Object type: CUBE, SPHERE, etc.
- `name` (String, Optional) - Custom object name
- `location` (String, Optional) - Position as "X,Y,Z" (e.g., "1,2,3")
- `rotation` (String, Optional) - Rotation as "RX,RY,RZ" (e.g., "0,0,1.57")
- `scale` (String, Optional) - Scale as "SX,SY,SZ" (e.g., "2,1,1")

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Use **comma-separated strings** for coordinates (not arrays)
- Object types must be **UPPERCASE** (CUBE, not cube)
- Empty fields will use Blender defaults

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Quick Reference - Object Types**

**Valid Object Types (MUST be UPPERCASE):**
- `CUBE` - Standard cube mesh
- `SPHERE` - UV sphere mesh  
- `CYLINDER` - Cylinder mesh
- `PLANE` - Flat plane mesh
- `CONE` - Cone mesh
- `TORUS` - Torus (donut) mesh
- `MONKEY` - Suzanne (Blender mascot) mesh

## üö® **Common Errors & Solutions**

### Error 1: "Invalid object type"
**Problem:** Using lowercase object types  
**Solution:** Always use uppercase: `CUBE`, `SPHERE`, `CYLINDER`, `PLANE`, `CONE`, `TORUS`, `MONKEY`

**Wrong:**
```
"Create a cube named 'test'"
```

**Correct:**
```
"Create a CUBE named 'test'"
```

### Error 2: "Connection refused" or "502 Bad Gateway"
**Problem:** Server not running or tunnel disconnected  
**Solution:** Check server status with health check prompt:
```
"Check if my Blender MCP server is running properly and show me the connection status."
```

### Error 3: Objects not appearing as expected
**Problem:** Incorrect coordinate system understanding  
**Solution:** Use specific coordinates and test with simple positions first:
```
"Create a CUBE at position 0,0,0 to test the coordinate system"
```

### Error 4: Coordinate format errors
**Problem:** Using wrong format for coordinates  
**Solution:** Use comma-separated strings without spaces:

**Wrong:**
```
"Create a CUBE at position [1, 2, 3]"
"Create a CUBE at position 1 2 3"
```

**Correct:**
```
"Create a CUBE at position 1,2,3"
```

## üí° **Pro Tips for Better Results**

### 1. **Start Simple**
Begin with basic objects before creating complex scenes:
```
"Create a CUBE named 'TestCube' to verify the connection"
```

### 2. **Use Descriptive Names**
Give objects meaningful names for easier management:
```
"Create a CYLINDER named 'MainPillar' instead of just 'Cylinder'"
```

### 3. **Plan Your Coordinates**
Think about object placement in 3D space:
- X-axis: Left (-) to Right (+)
- Y-axis: Back (-) to Front (+)  
- Z-axis: Down (-) to Up (+)

### 4. **Build Incrementally**
Create scenes step by step rather than all at once:
```
"First create the floor, then add walls, then furniture"
```

### 5. **Use Reference Objects**
Create a reference grid or marker objects:
```
"Create a PLANE named 'Grid' with scale 10,10,1 as a reference"
```
